Repository to maintain code related to machine learning studies and notes and Topic Modeling Tasks.

### Repository Structure
 * `datasets` ─ Datasets used in each problem or study case.
 * `src` ─ Source code.
 * `notes` ─ Study notes.
 * `docs` ─ Description related to each problem, or content listed in `src` directory.
 
 ### Commits pattern
 Each commit in this repository presents a **type** and a **description**, following this exactly format:
